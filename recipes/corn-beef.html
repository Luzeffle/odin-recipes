    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>So... it's the day after St. Patrick's and you're running a little short on time before
        you have to go out for the day. Not to worry! Here's a recipe for leftover corned beef
        hash that you can have ready in about half an hour and will fill up your belly at least
        until lunch!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5 red potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/4 inch thick</li>
        <li>1 pound cooked corned beef, sliced 1-inch thick</li>
        <li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 eggs, or more to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat until sizzling. Place potatoes in the oil and cook, turning every couple of minutes, until golden brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shred corned beef and toss into the pan. Cook until heated through, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and give a good stir. Crack eggs on top, sprinkle with more salt and pepper, and cover until eggs are set, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
