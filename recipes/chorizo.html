        <il>1/4 cup crumbled Cotija cheese</il>
        <il>1 tablespoon Mexican-style hot sauce (such as Valentina) (Optional)</il>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tomatoes, onion, cilantro, jalapeno, lime juice, minced garlic, and garlic salt in a bowl; stir to combine. Transfer 1/2 cup pico de gallo to a second bowl and stir in black beans. Cover both bowls and set in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sweet potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until browned and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook and stir chorizo in a second skillet over medium heat until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Distribute cooked chorizo, sweet potatoes, black bean mixture, and avocado amongst 4 bowls. Sprinkle with Cojita cheese.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Crack eggs into the pan and cook until outer edges become opaque, about 1 minute. Cover the skillet and reduce heat to low. Cook until whites are set and yolks are set to your desired firmness, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place an egg on top of each bowl. Serve with more pico de gallo and hot sauce.</li>
