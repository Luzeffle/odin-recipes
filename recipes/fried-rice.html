    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This breakfast fried rice is a twist on bacon and eggs! My dad used to make this 
        for me on Saturday mornings when I was a kid; it's an easy and tasty brunch option. 
        You can substitute one bunch of broccoli for frozen peas if desired.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>2 cups uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>6 slice bacon</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>4 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and 
            simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, occasionally turning, 
            until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon slices to a paper towel-lined 
            plate to drain and crumble into bite-size pieces; reserve rendered bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir eggs in the same skillet over medium heat until slightly set, 1 to 3 minutes. 
            Stir yellow onion, peas, green onion, and 1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce into eggs; cook and stir 
            until yellow onion is translucent, about 5 minutes more. Reduce heat to low; stir rice, crumbled 
            bacon, and remaining soy sauce into egg mixture until well-combined and heated through, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
